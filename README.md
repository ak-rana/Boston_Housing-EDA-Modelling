# Boston_Housing-EDA-Modelling

The Boston Housing Dataset  The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The following describes the dataset columns

## Dataset Description

The Boston Housing dataset is a classic regression dataset used in machine learning and statistics. It contains information about 506 houses in Boston, Massachusetts, and has 14 columns of data for each house:

- crim: per capita crime rate by town
- zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- chas: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- nox: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- rm: average number of rooms per dwelling
- age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- dis: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- rad: index of accessibility to radial highways
- tax: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town
- b: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- lstat: lower status of the population (percent)
- medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

The target variable, medv, represents the median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars. The other variables are used as predictors to build a model that can predict medv based on the other variables.

This dataset is often used in regression analysis and predictive modeling, and can be used to explore relationships between various factors and housing prices. It has been used in numerous studies and has become a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of regression models.

## Dataset EDA Implications

The following are some additional details about the Dataset EDA Implications for the Boston Housing Dataset:

- The dataset contains a mix of continuous and categorical variables, which requires different preprocessing steps and modeling techniques.
- The target variable, "medv" (median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s), is a continuous variable, suggesting that regression models will be appropriate for predicting it.
- Some of the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, which affect the performance of certain modeling techniques that assume independence between predictors. 
- The dataset contains several potential outliers and influential data points, which requires careful handling during modeling.
- The dataset has a relatively small number of observations, which  limits the complexity of models that can be used and increase the risk of overfitting.

Overall, the EDA of the Boston Housing Dataset suggests that careful consideration of preprocessing and modeling techniques will be required to effectively use the dataset for predictive modeling.

## Insights and Predictions from the Dataset
- The feature LSTAT (percentage of lower status of the population) has a strong negative correlation with MEDV, indicating that homes in areas with lower status populations tend to have lower values.
 - The feature RM (average number of rooms per dwelling) has a strong positive correlation with MEDV, indicating that homes with more rooms tend to have higher values.
- The model based on Decision Tree Regressor can predict the value of the median value of owner-occupied homes with a reasonable degree of accuracy, based on the available features.

- The feature PTRATIO (pupil-teacher ratio by town) has a moderate negative correlation with MEDV, indicating that homes in areas with higher pupil-teacher ratios tend to have lower values.
- The model can be further improved by using feature selection techniques and tuning hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
